** CLASSES *****************************************************************

Class in JavaScript is a BLUEPRINT for creating objects that have the same properties and access to the same methods.

What is Class Basics?
- Syntactic sugar on top of setting up prototype chains manually
- Class field to initialize object properties (same for every object.)
- constructor() method to initialize dynamic object properties
- You can "extend" from one class to another to access the goodness from parent class
